# ðŸŽ“ School Projects Repository

This repository contains source code for various computer science projects completed during my high school years.  
Each year (or course period) has its own folder containing one or more projects.

## ðŸ“¡ "Dead Air" 

**Year:** 2025  
**Description:**  
This project focused on handling encrypted radio communication on a BBC micro:bit The goal was to:

2. Decrypt the received transmissions using ROT13.  
3. Store the decrypted data efficiently for later processing or analysis.

**Skills & Technologies Used:**  
- 	Python
-  	Arrays for data handling  
-   Signal processing  
	

**Learning Outcome:**
